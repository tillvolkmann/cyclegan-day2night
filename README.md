# CycleGAN for day-to-night domain transfer of driving-related scenes
This repository contains CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) pytorch code for day-to-night domain tranfer of frames captured in driving-related context. Specifically, models were trained and tested on scenes element of the Berkeley Deep Drive data set (Yu et al., 2018).

### Prerequisites
Linux or OSX.
Python Python 3.
CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN.

### Datasets
Our original work used the Berkeley Deep Drive data set for training and testing of the CycleGAN model for day-to-night domain transfer. Please refer to Yu et al., 2018, BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Video Database with Scalable Annotation Tooling, ArXiv:1805.04687.

### Acknowledgments
Code is inspired by pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix by Zhu et al.
